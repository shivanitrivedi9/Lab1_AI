# Lab1_AI

Upon creating accounts of both of the major websites that are widely recognised for hosting repositories, I’ve come to the following conclusion on deciding which one is going to be my preference and why, on first comparing both on all the terms as given on the lab page I’ve come across the following:

Github:
You can use milestones to track progress in topic groups or monitor requests in the repository. GitHub's problems are very limited in portfolio management..
GitHub offers seamless integration with many tools and services, including CI/CD platforms, project management tools, code review tools, and more. 
It provides a rich ecosystem that improves the development workflow.
GitHub's exposure and networking opportunities are unmatched. It allows developers to present their projects, participate in others projects and build a strong professional network in the community..
GitHub offers both free and paid packages with features tailored for individuals, groups, and businesses..

GitLab:
Plan future work by creating epics and mapping all related issues to them. Create and track multiple milestones at the portfolio level to see room overtime and measure progress toward your goals.
GitLab positions itself as a complete DevOps platform, offering built-in CI/CD, issue tracking, project management and more in addition to version control. 
This integrated approach ensures a smooth workflow for development teams..
GitLab offers a community version that is open source and self-hosted, offering an attractive option for organizations looking for local solutions or better control over their data..
GitLab's built-in CI/CD pipelines are powerful and easy to install. They enable automated testing, deployment and monitoring directly on the platform..

Upon further consideration for the usage and grouping of my files and projects among with other people, as a member of a group or even individual workings, in order to grow my network and to make it easily accessible, I’ve chosen my host to be Github. As I prefer a large and active community, seamless integration with third-party tools, and visibility within the open-source community
